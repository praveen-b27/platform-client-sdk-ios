| **interval** | **String** | Behaves like one clause in a SQL WHERE. Specifies the date and time range of data being queried. Intervals are represented as an ISO-8601 string. For example: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss/YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss | |
| **granularity** | **String** | Date granularity of the results | [optional] |
| **metrics** | **[String]** | Behaves like a SQL SELECT clause. Enables retrieving only named metrics. If omitted, all metrics that are available will be returned (like SELECT *). | [optional] |
